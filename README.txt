# Focus
This is one of my first kinect 360 programs.

This program should focus on red objects. The program computed the average hight of the red objects and tilts the camera until the mean of the hight of the red objects is in the middle of the image.

# How to build?

$ cd /path/to/Focus
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./main

Have fun!
